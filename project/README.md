This Extension uses the username and displays a welcome message to the users' dog. I used: HTML, CSS & JS

How exactly does it work?

-- this extension works at Chrome browser once the user enables it and opens a new tab

-- the user can type a name that is stored in the local storage

-- then the personalized message appears

-- Additionally, the footer displays the personalized message depending on the week-day
